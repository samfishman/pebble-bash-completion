# Pebble Bash Completion

A simple bash completion script for the Pebble smartwatch SDK command line tool.

## Usage

You can install bash completion scripts by copying or symlinking them into your
`bash_completion.d` folder. On most linux systems, this can be found at
`/etc/bash_completion.d`. On a Mac with Homebrew, you should install the
`bash-completion` package (`brew install bash-completion`) and then use
`/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d`.
